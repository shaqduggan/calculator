to make changes to a repo 
1. make sure you are update using git fetch, the git pull 
2. create a new branch using git checkout -b <branch name> 
3. make changes 
4. add changes, commit changes, write commit message descriping changes  (using git add, git commit -m "message goes here")
5. push new branch to remote repo (git push -u (if it's a new branch) origin <branch name>) otherwise just git push
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) and fix conflicts if necessary 
7. Wait for someone else to review your code (approving your PR, make changes suggested by the person) (if you make changes, go back to 4)
8. when PR is approved, merge into master.
